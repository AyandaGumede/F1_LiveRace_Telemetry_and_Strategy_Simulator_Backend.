# F1 Live Race Telemetry & Strategy Simulator - Backend

This repository contains the backend services for the **F1 Live Race Telemetry & Strategy Simulator** project.

Built with **Spring Boot** (multi-module Maven project), it consists of:

- **api-gateway**: Handles authentication, routing, and security using Spring Security and JWT.
- **telemetry-service**: Simulates and streams real-time race telemetry data via WebSocket.
- **strategy-service**: Runs the pit stop prediction algorithms and exposes REST endpoints.
- **data-service**: Manages persistent storage of race data using PostgreSQL and InfluxDB.

The backend exposes REST APIs and WebSocket endpoints consumed by the Angular frontend. Itâ€™s designed for scalability and modularity, leveraging Docker and Docker Compose for local development.


### Key Features

- Real-time telemetry data streaming with WebSocket.
- Pit stop strategy prediction engine.
- Historical race data storage and replay support.
- Secure JWT-based authentication and authorization.
